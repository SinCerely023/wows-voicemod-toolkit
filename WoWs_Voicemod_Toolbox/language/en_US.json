  "HtmlHelp_Header": "<p>Thank you for using this toolbox! I hope you will read the following carefully before using!</p><p>This toolbox is designed to repair the old-version voiceover mods when temporarily losing authors' support so you can enjoy your favorite voices in future battles. In principle, this toolbox only updates the voiceover tag file (mod.xml) without changing the content and organization of the voice file (*.wem), so I believe that the repaired voiceover mods are still the works of original authors. Although these voiceover mods are temporarily lost from the original authors' maintenance, <font color=\"red\">you must not release or distribute the repaired voiceover mods without the original authors' permission. </font></p><p>To provide some help when any regrettable event happens, this toolbox will add removable digital watermarks to the voiceover tag files, including but not limited to the repairers' Wargaming ID. While it may not take long for players familiar with voiceover to find and remove these watermarks, I still hope that you will respect the original authors of the voiceover mods and maintain the modification community of World of Warships. </p>",
  "HtmlHelp_Body": "<hr><p><b>Help for use</b></p><p><b>1. Login Wargaming ID</b></p><p>Before using this toolbox, you need to log in to your Wargaming ID. Select your login server in the drop-down list in the [Setting] tab [Wargaming ID] group (servers of RU and 360 are not supported for login), then click [Login] and use your Wargaming ID to authorize in the pop-up page. If the login is successful, your ID and username will be displayed in the toolbox, and you can use other functions of the toolbox at this time.</p><p>The login function uses the Wargaming official API and records ID information locally only. Please log out of your ID or delete the file config.json before sharing this toolbox with friends.</p><p><b>2. Repair voiceover mod</b></p><p>The primary function of this toolbox is to repair old version voiceover mods so that they can work properly in new version games, avoiding the inclusion of the default commander voice. This toolbox supports most voiceover repairs from update 0.7.3 onwards and keeps it adapted to new version games mainly by updating the profiles. As the game version is updated, some voices inevitably become permanently invalid in the game. This toolbox can only replace and shield the voice tags; if you need deep customization or manual repair, please contact the toolbox's author for feasibility.</p><p>After logging in, click on the [Repair] tab and [Select...] or enter the voiceover mod.xml file path you want to repair in the [mod.xml to be repaired] text box. The recommended profile is used default. After selecting, [Generate Location] will be filled automatically, i.e., replacing the original mod.xml file. You can also choose another location to generate the repaired file. After clicking [Generate], the toolbox will automatically repair the voiceover mod you selected based on the profile. </p><p>It is recommended to place the voiceover mod in the appropriate path, as explained by the original author, before repairing it and using the default generation location. The correct path to place the voiceover mod.xml should be: %WoWs_client_path%\\bin\\%versionID%\\res_mods\\banks\\mods\\%voiceover_name%\\mod.xml</p><p><b>3. Generate voiceover mod</b></p><p>This toolbox supports the use of profiles to generate voiceover mod directories and automatically recognizes and generates mod.xml after placing voice files (.wem), with a similar mechanism as the voiceover tool <a href=\"https://forum.worldofwarships.com/topic/142239-tool-convert-old-voice-mods-to-work-with-0613-and-088/\">modxmlgenerator</a>. The mod.xml generated by this function does not contain a digital watermark and can be used unrestrictedly. </p><p>Click on the [Mod Generation] tab and [Select...] or enter the location of the directory for generating voiceover mod in the [Generate Location] text box in the [Mod Folder Generation] group. The recommended profile is used default. After clicking [Generate], a directory named \"mod_folders_rename\" will be automatically generated in [Generate Location] based on the selected profile. Please rename the directory to the name of the voiceover you want to generate. </p><p>After putting your voice files in the appropriate place in the directory and renaming the directory, click on the [mod generation] tab and [select...]  or enter the directory of the voiceover mod you created in the [generation location] text box in the [mod.xml generation] area. Click [Generate], and the corresponding mod.xml file will be automatically generated in [Generate Location] according to the directory hierarchy and the voice files.</p><p><b>4. Meta Tools</b></p><p>Meta tools contain the basic processing functions included in this toolbox. The files generated by these functions do not have digital watermarks and can be used unrestrictedly. </p><p><b>5. Interface setting</b></p><p>This toolbox supports multiple languages and automatically recognizes the system language at startup and matches it with existing language files. Additional language files can be written.</p><p><b>6. Version update</b></p><p>This toolbox supports online updates. If the voice system in the game has not changed a lot, you can adapt to the new version by only updating the profile. If the current toolbox version cannot be supported, you need to update the toolbox manually. \"Profile version\" is the latest game version of the local profile, and \"Compatible version\" is the game version when the local profile was built.</p><p>The toolbox will search for a new version of the toolbox or configuration file when starts or when you click [Update]. When updating, please ensure the network communication with github.com. The author of this toolbox will try the best to keep the profiles up-to-date with the game version as far as possible.</p><p><b>7. Generate profile offline</b></p><p>If the author of this toolbox stops updating the profile due to force majeure, players can generate the profile offline by using the data in the game client and using the <a href=\"https://forum.worldofwarships.com/topic/183662-all-wows-unpack-tool-unpack-game-client-resources/\">wowsunpack</a> carried by the toolbox or downloaded by themselves. </p><hr><p><b>Digital watermarking and copyright protection</b></p><p>If you find that your voiceover mod has been repaired and released by someone else without your permission and any explanation, and you believe this violates your rights as a voiceover author, you can contact me, the author of this toolbox. I am so sorry for the inconvenience this toolbox has caused you. I will do my best to extract the Wargaming ID information in the digital watermark from the mod.xml released by the other party and provide it to you. However, the mod.xml is a text file that anyone can entirely and thoroughly modify, so with my limited technical knowledge and ability, the encryption and embedding methods I use cannot absolutely guarantee that the digital watermark can be correctly identified and its information can be accurately read. Once again, I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to you! </p><p>If you believe that this toolbox directly infringes on your rights, you may communicate with me or Wargaming staffs (such as the Modification community managers).</p>",
